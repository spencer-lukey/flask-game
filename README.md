# flask-game
Using ADTs such as the Stack and Queue to make a flask-like game in the terminal


**Welcome to my most recently made game!**
_How do I play?_
Easy! Given one of the two pre-loaded flask states, the program will continually prompt you to enter the number of the flask you wish to pour from, and the flask you wish to pour into. Once a flask is full of all the same color/letter, it will close and will be pretty much unusable. The objective is to fill the flasks with all of the same color, and once done the program will terminate. If you wish to quit before you finish, just enter "quit" and the program will terminate.

**Have Fun!**
